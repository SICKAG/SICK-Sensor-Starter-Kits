# Getting started

You are now ready to get started with the IO-Link Connectivity Starter Kit. Follow along the instruction below or scroll down to the tutorial video.

## Setup

1.	Connect the SIG300 with the USB-C cable and power supply.
2.	Choose the correct plug adapter and plug the power supply into an outlet.
3.	Connect the USB-C cable to the PC.
4.	Open a browser and enter the default IP address 169.254.0.1
5.	Connect the sensors W10, UC12 and IM30 with the IO-Link cables to the SIG300
6.	The devices are now ready to use. Make sure to select “Keep default password”.
7.	The sensors can be mounted onto the assembled frame (see below) with the mounting brackets (only applies with a Mounting Kit - 1154060)

## Setup Mounting Frame (only applies with Mounting Kit)

**Required Hardware**

* 5 × Aluminum profiles
* 8 × End caps
* 8 × Countersunk screws
* 8 × M5 T-slot nuts
* 1 × M4 T-slot nut
* 4 × Angle brackets
* 1 × Hex key (3 mm)**

**Top Bar**

* Take one aluminum profile from the box.
* Insert one M4 T-slot nut into the top groove.
* Insert two M5 T-slot nuts into the bottom groove (opposite side of the M4 nut).
* Attach two angle brackets using countersunk screws and tighten them into the M5 T-slot nuts with a hex key.
* Place end caps on both ends of the profile.
* Slide the angle brackets to both ends of the profile and tighten the screws so that the angle brackets and end caps are aligned.

**Bottom Bars (x2)**

* Insert one M5 T-slot nut into the center groove of each bar.
* Attach one angle bracket with countersunk screws and tighten using the hex key.
* Place end caps on both ends.
* Position both profiles parallel in front of you, oriented lengthwise, so the ends point toward you and away from you—not sideways across the table.

**Vertical Bars (x2)**

* Insert one M5 T-slot nut at the bottom end of each bar.
* Mount each vertical bar at a 90° angle to one bottom bar using a countersunk screw and a 3 mm hex key.
* Insert one M5 T-slot nut at the top end of each bar in the groove facing the other bottom bar.
* Place an end cap on the top of each vertical bar.
Use the two remaining countersunk screws to mount the top bar between the two vertical bars with the angle brackets and hex key.
* Tip: It may be easier to lay the frame down to mount the top bar.
* Adjust the height and angle of the top bar by loosening and tightening the two inner screws at the top of the vertical bars.

**Final Step**

* Mount the Inspector61x bracket using the supplied M4 screw and washer to the T-slot nut on top of the top bar.

**Now you are ready start, feel free to try out or choose an [example project](./iolink_example_projects.md) or [code snippets](./iolink_code_snippets.md) or check out the [training materials](./iolink_training_material.md) from below**

## Troubleshooting

   1. Make sure you are disconnected from any VPN as this may block the connection to the network device.
   2. If you can't connect to the network device, check if the LED **"Ready"** is green.  
      If not, the power supply is not correctly established. Wait up to 2 minutes and check if the power supply is connected correctly.

   3. If you still can’t connect, look up the device IP address via **SICK AppManager**:  
      [SICK AppManager | SICK](https://www.sick.com/ag/en/catalog/products/machine-vision-and-identification/machine-vision/inspectorp61x/c/g555810)  
      Go to the **Advanced section** for details.

   4. Check the **FAQ section**: [FAQ Link](https://www.sick.com)

   5. If the device still has issues:  
      - Go to the **Support Portal**, register, and create a case to get assistance.
